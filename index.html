          This is my first major programming project from AP CSP. My partner
          Josh and I programmed a draggable pen tool, polygon tool, star tool,
          daisy tool, circle tool, and eraser tool, with a directions popup
          displaying keybinds. Color is manipulable through an RGB slider, and
          line thickness through a slide as well.

          This is my final version of my AP CSP "Create Task" program, a drawing application.. My partner
          Josh and I programmed a draggable pen tool, polygon tool, star tool,
          daisy tool, circle tool, saving connect-the-dots tool, and eraser tool, with a directions popup
          displaying keybinds. Color is manipulable through an RGB slider, and
          line thickness through a slider as well.

          This is a scratch football game I made with Riley, Noah, and Lucas. I
          mainly worked on code. Riley worked on code, glitch finding, and
          backstory. Noah worked on refining graphics, and Lucas on sound design
          and some early character design. This was a project that we were given
          around a month to complete, and it took us as long. The biggest
          challenge for me (and most frustrating part) was fixing glitches Riley
          found, especially with all the moving parts to the game, and the most
          fun was implementing new mechanics like power and aiming. According to
          Riley, our game includes 1200+ blocks of code.

          For my spring Genius Hour, I used Tinkercad (a 3-D modeling program),
          to design a Beechcraft King Air F90, and two flight paths, which I
          planned to 3D print. This project was in conjunction with a Calculus
          BC project on efficiency of different flight paths.
