          This is a short showcase of my first fusion assignment, where I had to
          follow blueprints with dimensions to model 16 different parts. I had
          YouTube videos available for help as well. I learned how to use
          various modeling tools in fusion, such as extrude, sketch, as well as
          how to use constraints (such as the "tangent" or "coincident"
          constraints) in sketches. I also learned how to render these parts inÂ 
          variety of materials and finishes. Below are my favorite parts,
          showcased.

          This is a project from Advanced Engineering where my team and I
          designed a cardboard bridge on AutoCad, and laser cut it, with the
          restrictions of a maximum length of 400mm and max span of 300mm. We
          adopted a Howe-Truss design with a supportive arch on the underside
          and horizontal supportive midsection. Assembly was done through
          verticle slots that fit into holes on the bridges roof and floor. Our
          bridge, which was the classes heaviest, held a class-best 71?lbs at
          the classes 4th?-highest efficiency of 208X? (out of eight or so
          teams). In the future, I would further reinforce each edge of the
          bridge, and bend over and connect connection tabs on the bridges floor
          to prevent them from slipping out of their slot.

          For my spring Genius Hour, I used Tinkercad (a 3-D modeling program),
          to design a Beechcraft King Air F90, and two flight paths, which I
          planned to 3D print. This project was in conjunction with a Calculus
          BC project on efficiency of different flight paths.

            Blade Design Data</a

        <p>
          In Advanced Engineering and Design, our third major project after our bridge was a wind turbine. We started by assembling a turbine with provided parts and balsa wood blades, with which we tested different angles and their power output. Then, using KidWind Learning to design new blades with an airfoil, we 3D printed through BambuLab and installed PLA blades and tested more angles as well as gearing, eventually settling on a 1:16 gear ration, 3 blades, and a 7 degree angle of attack, resulting in 104mA of current, 10.7V of voltage, and 1.113W of power produced. Below is a video of our final test and some extra photos from the project. My group participated in the online simulation challenge, where we submitted our turbine online through KidWind Learning along with data and reports. The main constrictive rule of the project were that our turbine had to fit within the measurements of 36"x36". In the project, my primary role was organizing our data and records, and designing our new, 3D printed blades. I wrote the majority of our report, turned in our online submission, and designed our PLA blades. I learned that theoretical performance is very different from experimental performance, and a lot about how wind turbines work during our projects research segment. Our optimized blades really only took into account shape, and not so much weight, meaning that our 3D printing settings likely used more material than necessary, increasing weight and decreasing efficiency, something we could change in the future. We also probably should have added some blade twist to our blades to account for different rotational velocities at different points on the blades leading edge. Our PLA blades broke at the attachment point twice, meaning we had to reprint twice, and our attachment peg had to be sanded down to fit. These were significant challenges that decreased our allotted time for the project, which only makes our end product more impressive in my mind. As for small details I'm proud of of group for, we sanded our blades down at the points where each blade segment connected, decreasing drag. We were also the quickest to 3D print and had some of the class's most efficient blades theoretically. And our turbine name (Gale Warden) was the class's best.
