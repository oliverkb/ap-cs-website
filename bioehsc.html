          This is an overview of the bioengineering project I participated in with Kai, Emlio, Josh, and Jesse through UC Berkeley. We specifically competed in the biological field (vs. medical), with our project topic being a Banana Based PLA (Polylactic Acid) Plastic. The competition took roughly 6 weeks, with most of it being research about our topics feasaability and the creation of presentation-driving materials, like posters, slideshows, and abstracts. On a Saturday, we physically traveled to the UC Berkeley campus to present our poster and slideshow presentation. Poster presentations were like a gallery walk, where judges came up and gave you two minutes to do an "industry pitch", then asked follow-up questions for four minutes. Slideshow presentations were longer and more organized, taking place in a private room with a panel of two to three judges with ten minutes of presenting and five minutes of questioning, in what was called an "academic pitch". We had to do each type of presentation twice to different judges, with an ending count of four presentations throughout the day. The day in Berkeley lasted from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon. We were catered with a Vietnamese lunch and got to tour the campus, even going into some of the labs and hearing a lecture about a professor's work towards solving Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) with a home-testing system.
