          This is a short showcase of my first fusion assignment, where I had to
          follow blueprints with dimensions to model 16 different parts. I had
          YouTube videos available for help as well. I learned how to use
          various modeling tools in fusion, such as extrude, sketch, as well as
          how to use constraints (such as the "tangent" or "coincident"
          constraints) in sketches. I also learned how to render these parts inÂ 
          variety of materials and finishes. Below are my favorite parts,
          showcased.

          This is a project from Advanced Engineering where my team and I
          designed a cardboard bridge on AutoCad, and laser cut it, with the
          restrictions of a maximum length of 400mm and max span of 300mm. We
          adopted a Howe-Truss design with a supportive arch on the underside
          and horizontal supportive midsection. Assembly was done through
          verticle slots that fit into holes on the bridges roof and floor. Our
          bridge, which was the classes heaviest, held a class-best 71?lbs at
          the classes 4th?-highest efficiency of 208X? (out of eight or so
          teams). In the future, I would further reinforce each edge of the
          bridge, and bend over and connect connection tabs on the bridges floor
          to prevent them from slipping out of their slot.
