          This is a short showcase of my first fusion assignment, where I had to
          follow blueprints with dimensions to model 16 different parts. I had
          YouTube videos available for help as well. I learned how to use
          various modeling tools in fusion, such as extrude, sketch, as well as
          how to use constraints (such as the "tangent" or "coincident"
          constraints) in sketches. I also learned how to render these parts inÂ 
          variety of materials and finishes. Below are my favorite parts,
          showcased.

          This is a project from Advanced Engineering where my team and I
          designed a cardboard bridge on AutoCad, and laser cut it, with the
          restrictions of a maximum length of 400mm and max span of 300mm. We
          adopted a Howe-Truss design with a supportive arch on the underside
          and horizontal supportive midsection. Assembly was done through
          verticle slots that fit into holes on the bridges roof and floor. Our
          bridge, which was the classes heaviest, held a class-best 71?lbs at
          the classes 4th?-highest efficiency of 208X? (out of eight or so
          teams). In the future, I would further reinforce each edge of the
          bridge, and bend over and connect connection tabs on the bridges floor
          to prevent them from slipping out of their slot.

          For my fall Genius Hour, I followed a youtube tutorial to assemble 3D printed parts to a V2 engine (along with an included engine, using included screws and tools). The files were included with the project, and I imported into Bambu Labs, from where I added support and changed the infill, printing on Bambu Labs P1P and P1S printers. It had 10+ plates to print.

            Blade Design Data</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In Advanced Engineering and Design, our third major project after our bridge was a wind turbine. We started by assembling a turbine with provided parts and balsa wood blades, with which we tested different angles and their power output. Then, 
          using KidWind Learning to design new blades with an airfoil, we 3D printed through BambuLab and installed PLA blades and tested more angles as well as gearing.
          My group participated in the online simulation challenge, where we submitted our turbine online through KidWind Learning along with data and reports. The main constrictive rule of the project were that our turbine had to fit within the measurements 
          of 36"x36". Our final settings and output were a 1:16 gear ration, 3 blades, and a 7 degree angle of attack, resulting in 104mA of current, 10.7V of voltage, and 1.113W of power produced. 
          In the project, my primary role was organizing our data and records, and designing our new, 3D printed blades. I wrote the majority of our report, turned in our online submission, and designed our PLA blades. I learned that theoretical performance 
          is very different from experimental performance, and a lot about how wind turbines work during our projects research segment. Our optimized blades really only took into account shape, and not so much weight, meaning that our 3D printing settings likely 
          used more material than necessary, increasing weight and decreasing efficiency, something we could change in the future. We also probably should have added some blade twist to our blades to account for different rotational velocities at different points 
          on the blades leading edge. Our PLA blades broke at the attachment point twice, meaning we had to reprint twice, and our attachment peg had to be sanded down to fit. These were significant challenges that decreased our allotted time for the project, which 
          only makes our end product more impressive in my mind. As for small details I'm proud of group for, we sanded our blades down at the points where each blade segment connected, decreasing drag. We were also the quickest to 3D print and had some of the 
          class's most efficient blades theoretically. And our turbine name (Gale Warden) was the class's best.

          In advanced engineering we made neopixel lightsabers using the app Thonny to program a microcontroller similar to a Raspberry Pi Pico. I worked with my partner Emilio Scott. We made a pink-bladed saber with a battery pack for power, switch to toggle on and off, orange 3d printed case with a housing for the microcntroller board, and a progressive turning on or off animation.

          This is an overview of the bioengineering project I participated in with Kai, Emlio, Josh, and Jesse through UC Berkeley, which was also our Genius Hour topic for the spring. We specifically competed in the biological field (vs. medical), with our project topic being a Banana Based PLA (Polylactic Acid) Plastic. The competition took roughly 6 weeks, with most of it being research about our topics feasaability and the creation of presentation-driving materials, like posters, slideshows, and abstracts. On a Saturday, we physically traveled to the UC Berkeley campus to present our poster and slideshow presentation. Poster presentations were like a gallery walk, where judges came up and gave you two minutes to do an "industry pitch", then asked follow-up questions for four minutes. Slideshow presentations were longer and more organized, taking place in a private room with a panel of two to three judges with ten minutes of presenting and five minutes of questioning, in what was called an "academic pitch". We had to do each type of presentation twice to different judges, with an ending count of four presentations throughout the day. The day in Berkeley lasted from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon. We were catered with a Vietnamese lunch and got to tour the campus, even going into some of the labs and hearing a lecture about a professor's work towards solving Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) with a home-testing system.

          This is a CrunchLabs Hack Pack Label Maker I made with my partner Emilio. We built it first, then tested out a "canned" (essentially provided) modification, which turned the label maker into a free-draw tool, and then made a custom hack, which replaced the input string "KAISER" with "GRADER".
